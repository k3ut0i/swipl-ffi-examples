* Call SWI-Prolog from C
A couple of examples calling SWI-Prolog from C.

[[between_c.c]] calls the predicate ~between/3~ and gets all the numbers.
[[consult_file.c]] loads the file [[digits.pl]] and the finds all numbers that satisfy ~digit/1~.

Compile it as follows.
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  swipl-ld -o between between_c.c
  swipl-ld -o consult_digits consult_file.c 
#+end_src
